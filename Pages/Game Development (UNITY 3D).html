                <p>
                    Game development, production, or design is a process that starts from an idea or concept. Often the
                    idea is based on a modification of an existing game concept. The game idea may fall within one or
                    several genres. Designers often experiment with different combinations of genres. As per Google
                    statistics, there are a total of 1.4 billion active Android devices around the Globe. Out of
                    3,000,000 apps, available on the Google Play Store, there are all types and kinds of apps which may
                    be treated as game apps.

                    <p>

                        As a whole, almost 1000 billion hours of user time are 
spent on gameplay while 13 billion games and other apps 
are downloaded from the Google Play Store. With this 
storyline, 10,000 app developers are busy with Game 
Development. There is a trillion-dollar market that is open 
for the developers of the games, apps, and other related 
software for Android devices.
<br><br>

One can say, safely, that skyâ€™s the limit for the games and 
app developers. Still, Google is encouraging the developers 
to make more and more apps for Android users as the apps are 
not coming edge to edge with the ever-increasing number of 
android users. So, this is the time to enter the development 
area, not only for the games but also for the apps.
<br><br>

From smartphones, Android has now ventured into smartwatches, 
home appliances, cars, and TV units. And, it would continue 
to grow tremendously bringing immense job opportunities for 
Android experts. Florida Trainings experts teach their 
students Android Game Development Courses in Orlando with 
effective content and training.

Unity is an incredible 3D package used for making video 
games, architectural and medical imaging and more. The 
challenge is that it's big and complicated to use, especially 
for complete beginners to coding and game development. 
We make learning to code easy and fun by leading you 
step-by-step through the process of creating exciting games.
<br><br>

If you're reading this you probably already have everything 
you need to get started. Unity is a free download. With 
regular access to an internet connection you'll be able to 
engage in our thriving community. Even if you have no 
experience with coding, or with 3D packages, we will guide 
you through everything from first principles. Starting slow, 
then building on what you learn, you'll soon have a very 
solid working knowledge of Unity.
<br><br>

The course is project-based, so you will not just be learning 
dry programming concepts, but applying them immediately to 
real indie games as you go. All the project files will be 
included, as well as additional references and resources - 
you'll never get stuck. There are "talking heads", 
powerful diagrams, quality screencasts and more.
<br><br>

<h5><b>Here are some things we will not be covering in detail...:</b></h5><br>

:: Art asset creation (assets provided but not made on-screen).<br>
:: Advanced performance optimization.<br>
:: Editor plugins or modifications.<br>
:: Physics engine modification.<br><br>

Anyone who wants to learn to create games: Unity 3D is a 
fantastic platform which enables you to make production-
quality games. Furthermore these games can be created for 
Windows, MacOS, iOS (even iOS 9), Android and Web from a 
single source!
