                <p>
                    Web Development is the process of creating a website for the internet. When it comes to developing a
                    website and getting it up and running, various processes are involved, such as coding, programming,
                    and designing. Web Development is concerned with the code or programming side of a website, which
                    allows it to run and function effectively. It mostly focuses on the non-design aspects of Website
                    Development.

                    <h5><b>The following are some of the advantages of studying Web
                            Development:</b></h5><br>

                    <h5><b>STAGGERING DEMAND:</b></h5>

                    Businesses are always on the hunt for talented web developers
                    and designers, and the demand is only likely to increase
                    in the future.
                    <br><br>

                    <h5><b>WORK FLEXIBILITY:</b></h5>

                    Work as a freelancer, part-time, full-time, for a company,
                    for the government, for yourself, from home, or even while
                    on vacation in the Bahamas! The freedom that a developer has
                    is incredible.
                    <br><br>

                    <h5><b>GOOD MOOLA:</b></h5>

                    It’s also profitable. A few hours of work are frequently
                    rewarded with significant money, making it a very worthwhile
                    and sought-after employment choice. <br><br>

                    <h5><b>QUALIFICATION:</b></h5>

                    There is no requirement for a college diploma: To work as a
                    web developer, you don’t always require a master’s degree
                    in computer science. You are hired based on your knowledge
                    and your website portfolio. Your knowledge/theory will get
                    you an interview; your work/portfolio will get you the job.
                    <br><br>

                    <h5><b>SUCCESS:</b></h5>

                    It goes beyond monetary benefits and even beyond ourselves.
                    You have the power to help and influence people not only
                    locally but even globally in ways, you can’t conceive!
                    <br><br>

                    <h5><b>What is the significance of Web Development?</b></h5><br>

                    The Internet isn’t going away anytime soon. In reality,
                    it has evolved into the world’s principal portal for
                    research, connection, education, and entertainment. In
                    2021, there were 4.66 billion Internet users worldwide,
                    accounting for more than half of the world’s population.
                    It’s no wonder that web development is a quickly growing
                    sector, given the rapidly increasing number of Internet
                    users. Web developer employment is predicted to expand by
                    13% between now and 2030, far faster than most other
                    technological jobs. For further info check our Facebook
